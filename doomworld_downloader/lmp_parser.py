Stub: lmp parser

TODO: We can start working on this earlier. Please operate off the following assumptions:
  - You're provided an lmp in a local directory
  - For now, we can use Kraflab's parse_lmp tool:
    - Assume the user of the script has Ruby installed
    - Add a property to upload.ini that is points to the path of the parse_lmp script
  - Your output should be a dictionary of all relevant info for the final JSON
