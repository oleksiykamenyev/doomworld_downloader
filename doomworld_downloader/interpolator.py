Stub: interpolator

TODO: This is a class to interpolate info from a variety of dictionary sources:
  - Your input is a set of dictionary sources for various info.
  - Each source has an additional bit of info that indicates whether it is 100% correct or not
  - If two 100% accurate sources disagree, need a way to let the person running the script know that
    there was a potential problem
  - If there's one unambigious 100% accurate source, no need to do this
  - If two possibly inaccurate sources disagree, and there is no unambiguous source, need to let the
    user know there was a potential problem
  - Your output should be a JSON of the inteprolated info
