Here's a set of options for work people can pick up:
  - Working on the LMP info parser
    - For starters, this can use kraf's parse_lmp library, long-term would be nice to do it
      natively.
  - Working on the textfile parser
  - Working on parsing through the raw post info
  - Working on PrBoom+ levelstat parser
  - Working on a generalized interpolator between the above sources of info

Ideally, for the lmp-related parsers above, we will sanity check the demos so we don't bother
uploading demos that are not valid (e.g., Stroller demos that have strafe tics or tics above
MF/MB25).

If you're really bored of coding, there's a few configs that would be nice-to-have:
  - WAD config that combines all relevant WAD info
    - Ideally, it would contain the following:
        - DSDA URLs (old and new preferably, just in case), idgames URLs, WAD names, internal WAD
          files, other info for auto-playback, if you're really ambitious, complevel info and a list
          of all mapslots would be cool for long-term DSDA features
  - WAD exceptions list: list maps that have missing monsters/secrets for valid max runs

If you're even more bored, you can try to add comments and work on some of the less-priority in-line
TODOs. Or start working on a test suite.

Maintenance:
  - regular updates of thread map to include new WADs and any new threads to ignore
