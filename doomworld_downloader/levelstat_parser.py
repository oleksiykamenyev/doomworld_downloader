Stub: levelstat parser

TODO: We can possibly start working on this earlier. Please operate off the following assumptions:
  - Your input is a path to the demo locally as well as the post and textfile info if needed.
    - We may need info from the other sources to make this work. Specifically, the following info
      may be necessary to run PrBoom+ for a given demo:
        - WAD file name and required parameters to run PrBoom+ for a given wad
        - -solo-net param if the demo doesn't automatically provide that
        - Long-term, we may need source port info in certain cases
  - Assume that the user has the correct info of PrBoom+ installed
    - Please use the upload.ini config file to get a property with the path locally
  - Your output should be a dictionary of all relevant info for the final JSON
